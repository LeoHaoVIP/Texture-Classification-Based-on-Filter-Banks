# Texture Classification Based on Filter Bank

This project is an implementation for Texture Classification based on different filter banks, coded in Python language.

Here we use 5 different filter banks to get image's filter response, which are S, LMS, LML, RFS and MR8.

## Project Structure

+ Runnable Python source file is [TextureClassification.py](./TextureClassification.py), which includes dictionary training, texture model construction and novel image prediction, just clone the repository and run it!
+ Texture images dataset is in [KTH_TIPS_GRAY](./KTH_TIPS_GRAY) directory, which contains 10 texture classes for model training and testing.
+ Filter banks generating scripts is not implements by us, you can MATLAB code for filter banks in [external_matlab_scripts](./external_matlab_scripts).
+ Here we just load the output of MATLAB scripts to get each image's filter response, the mat file is in [filter_banks]('./filter_banks') directory.
+ [Dataset](./dataset) and [dictionary](./dictionary) directories are the output of the runnable Python script, [dataset](./dataset) is the histogram set of training images while [dictionary](./dictionary) is learned from the dataset with Kmeans.
