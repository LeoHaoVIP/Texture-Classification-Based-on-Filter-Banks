# Texture Classification Based on Filter Bank

This project is an implementation for Texture Classification based on different filter banks, coded in Python language.

Here we use 5 different filter banks to get image's filter response, which are S, LMS, LML, RFS and MR8.

## Project Structure

+ Runnable Python source file is [TextureClassification.py](./TextureClassification.py), which includes dictionary training, texture model construction and novel image prediction.
JUST CLONE THE REPOSITORY AND RUN IT!
+ Texture image dataset is in [KTH_TIPS_GRAY](./KTH_TIPS_GRAY) directory, which contains 10 texture classes for dictionary learning, model training and testing.
+ Scripts for generating filter banks are not implemented in Python, you can get MATLAB code for filter banks in [external_matlab_scripts](./external_matlab_scripts). These MATLAB scripts are from [Here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/texclass/filters.html).
+ Here we just load the output(mat data file) of MATLAB scripts and convolve it with image to get each image's filter response, the mat file is in [filter_banks](./filter_banks) directory.
+ [Dataset](./dataset) and [dictionary](./dictionary) directories are outputs of the runnable Python script, [dataset](./dataset) is the histogram set of training images while [dictionary](./dictionary) is learned from the dataset using Kmeans algorithm.
+ P.S. Clear the two directory ([Dataset](./dataset) and [dictionary](./dictionary)) to rebuild texton dictionary and retrain the classifier.
